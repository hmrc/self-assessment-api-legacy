This section allows software packages to provide sole trader's financial data for their property business, 
including but not limited to income, expense, allowances etc. for a specified tax year (based on the accounting 
period of the business) so that the taxpayer can meet their uk-property obligations and/or retrieve their obligations.

Here, the developer can provide:

* UK Property Income for both Furnished Holiday Lettings (FHL) and Other rentals (e.g. rent income)
* UK Property Expenses (total by type of expense, e.g. premises running costs)
* Allowances (e.g. annual investment allowance)
* Adjustments (e.g. loss brought forward)
* Balancing charges

Furnished Holiday Lettings (FHL) are short term (e.g. 1-2 weeks) lets of a furnished property. Other is used 
for any normal rented property. 
Please see [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/furnished-holiday-lettings-hs253-self-assessment-helpsheet) for further guidance
regarding FHL properties.

Please note that the taxpayer's property business must already be known to HMRC as per the subscription process.

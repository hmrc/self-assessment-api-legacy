[HMRC Developer Sandbox](https://test-developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation) is an enhanced testing service that functions as a simulator of our production environment. 
It allows enhanced integration testing of your application with HMRC APIs without affecting the production environment. 

The _Self Assessment (MTD) API_  is whitelisted in Sandbox. If you require access, please contact the SDSTeam at SDSTeam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk.

It may not be possible to test all the scenarios in Sandbox. Such scenarios can be tested by passing the _Gov-Test-Scenario_ header. 
Documentation for each endpoint includes a **Test data** section, explaining which scenarios can be simulated using the _Gov-Test-Scenario_ header.
 
If you have a specific testing need which is not yet supported in Sandbox please contact the SDSTeam.

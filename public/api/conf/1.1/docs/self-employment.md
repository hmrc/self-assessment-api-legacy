These resources allow software packages to provide a taxpayer's financial data for their self-employment businesses. 
This data includes income, expenses, allowances and adjustments for each self-employment business.

Here, a software package can provide:

* Business Income (e.g. turnover)
* Business Expenses (total & disallowable by type of expense, e.g. travel costs)
* Tax Allowances for vehicles & equipment (e.g. capital allowances)
* Adjustments (e.g. basis adjustment)
* Balancing charges
* Goods & Services for own use

Please note that the taxpayer's self-employment businesses must already be known to HMRC as per the subscription process.

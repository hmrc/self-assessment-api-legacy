Only taxpayers subscribed to Making Tax Digital for Business for tax years 2017/18 onwards can use the API. As part of the subscription process, the user supplies HMRC with the following information:
* the name of their business
* their accounting period
* whether they use cash or accruals accounting

HMRC uses this information to create a record for each business and define its quarterly obligations for the accounting year. Each obligation has a start date and an end date - which together form the quarterly obligation period. To meet the obligations for each business, the taxpayer or their agent must:
* submit summarised income and expense updates covering the whole quarter
* request a tax calculation
* complete these tasks within 1 month of the end of the quarter

The data for each quarter can be provided as a single update covering the whole period, or as multiple smaller updates - providing there are no gaps or overlaps. If the data submitted in an update covers more than one quarter, that data must be split to ensure itâ€™s included in the right quarter. 

More accurate tax calculations can be provided if a business submits data on allowances and adjustments and personal income. However, this data is not a mandatory requirement.

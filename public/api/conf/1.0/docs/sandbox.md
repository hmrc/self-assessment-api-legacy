The [HMRC Developer Sandbox](https://test-developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation) is a testing service that allows enhanced integration testing of your application with HMRC APIs without affecting the production environment.

The Self Assessment (MTD) API is whitelisted in Sandbox. If you require access, please contact the SDS Team at SDSTeam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk.

It may not be possible to test all scenarios in Sandbox. Some scenarios can be tested by passing the _Gov-Test-Scenario_ header. Documentation for each endpoint includes a **Test data** section, explaining which scenarios 
can be simulated using the _Gov-Test-Scenario_ header. 

If you have a specific testing need which is not yet supported in Sandbox please contact the SDS Team.

These resources allow software packages to provide a taxpayer's financial data for their UK property business. 
This data includes income, expenses, allowances and adjustments for their UK property business.

Here, the developer can provide:

* UK property business income for both Furnished Holiday Lettings (FHL) and Other rentals (e.g. rent income)
* UK property business expenses (total by type of expense, e.g. premises running costs)
* Allowances (e.g. annual investment allowance)
* Adjustments (e.g. loss brought forward)
* Balancing charges

Furnished Holiday Lettings (FHL) are short term (e.g. 1-2 weeks) lets of a furnished property. For all other UK 
properties, use "Other". 
Please see [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/furnished-holiday-lettings-hs253-self-assessment-helpsheet) for further guidance
regarding FHL properties.

Please note that the taxpayer's UK property business must already be known to HMRC as per the subscription process.

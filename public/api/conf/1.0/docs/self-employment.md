This section allows software packages to provide sole trader's financial data for each of their self-employment businesses, 
including but not limited to income, expense, allowances etc. for a specified tax year (based on the accounting period 
of the business) so that the taxpayer can meet their self-employment obligations and/or retrieve their obligations.

Here, a software package can provide:

* Business Income (e.g. turnover)
* Business Expenses (total & disallowable by type of expense, e.g. travel costs)
* Tax Allowances for vehicles & equipment (e.g. capital allowances)
* Adjustments (e.g. basis adjustment)
* Balancing charges
* Goods & Services for own use

Please note that the taxpayer's self-employment businesses must already be known to HMRC as per the subscription process.

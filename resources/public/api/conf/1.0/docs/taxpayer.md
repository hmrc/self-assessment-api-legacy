This section allows API developers to discover the taxpayer’s information and
all the resources available under a tax year.

Here, the developer can get the following data:

- Taxpayer’s UTR (Unique Taxpayer Reference is a 10 digit number that is unique to the taxpayer)
- All the tax years HMRC holds tax records for
- Liability calculation resource for each of those tax years
- All the income sources for the given tax year

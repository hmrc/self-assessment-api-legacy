### Obligations ###

The _obligations_ are defined as a set of date periods for which a taxpayer must provide summary income and expense 
data. Each obligation has a start date and an end date which together define the _obligation period_. For MTD, each 
business has multiple obligations which are based on its accounting period. 

Please note â€“ when calling the _retrieve obligations_ (Self Employment or Property) following an update to check whether a
customer's obligation has been met. It can take up to an hour for the _obligation_ to be updated within HMRC systems,
so it is best to wait for an hour before calling the endpoint for an up to date picture.

### Update period ###
A period of time within an obligation, for which the taxpayer can submit summarised income and expense data. This can cover anything from a day to the duration of the whole obligation period - so data can be provided as a single update covering the whole period, or as multiple smaller updates.

### Annual summary ###
An _annual summary_ is defined as a set of summary data for a tax year, containing allowances and adjustments broken down by category. 

### End of period statement ###
_End of period statement (EOPS)_  is the process that allows the customer to finalise their business income. A customer must complete an EOPS for each source of business income (the equivalent of the current SA103 and SA105 forms) E.g. if a customer has a self-employment business and a property business then they will have to complete 2 EOPS one for each source of income.
The EOPS is linked to the accounting period for each source of income and cannot be completed until the end of the accounting period. However the customer does not need to complete it until 31st January Year 2.   

### Crystallisation ###
This is the process that allows the customer to finalise their end of year position. This includes any business and personal data they need to provide to HMRC to reach their final tax liability for a specific year.

These resources allow software packages to trigger a year-to-date tax calculation for a taxpayer. A calculation may only 
be triggered when an update has been provided. 

When a tax calculation is triggered, a check will also be performed to see whether or not the taxpayer has 
met their obligations. If you wish to retrieve the status of the taxpayers updated obligations, you can use the 
provided obligation APIs.

In test, this API will return pre-defined representative responses. These may include fields that are not yet possible
to populate via the API.

Here, the developer can:

* Trigger a tax calculation
* Retrieve the result of a previously triggered tax calculation

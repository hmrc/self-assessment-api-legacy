This API allows software packages to provide sole trader's financial data for each of their self-employment businesses 
and/or for their property business, including but not limited to income, expense, allowances etc. as well as data for 
other personal income (such as interest from savings, dividends) for a specified tax year (based on the accounting 
period of the business) so that the taxpayer can meet their obligations and/or request a tax calculation.

To meet their obligations, taxpayers are required to submit financial updates during the year for 
each of their self-employment businesses, and/or for their property business. Typically these are four 3-month 
obligation periods, one set per business, but there could be for example, an additional shorter obligation period in 
the first year of a business.

To meet an obligation for a particular _obligation period_ for a particular business, taxpayers 
are required to:

* Supply summarised transactions for income and expenditure for the the whole of the _obligation period_ for that 
specific business.
* Request a tax calculation

The data for each obligation period can be provided either as a single _update period_, or as multiple smaller 
_update periods_, covering the whole period, so long as there are no gaps, no overlaps among the _update periods_.

This API allows software packages to provide data relating to sole traders and their businesses including but not limited to income, expense, allowances etc. as well as data for other personal income (such as interest from savings, dividends) for a specified tax year (based on the accounting period of the business).

This API is usable only for taxpayers subscribed to Making Tax Digital (MTD) and only for tax years 2017/18 onwards.

Self-employment and property businesses may created as part of the MTD subscription process.

This API can be used to submit data relating to:
* Self-employment
* Property, including furnished holiday lettings
* Dividends and interest

So that Self-Assessment obligations can be met.

Some APIs may be marked "test only"; this means that they are not available for use in production.

This is the process that allows the customer to finalise their end of year position. This includes any business and personal data they need to provide to HMRC to reach their final tax liability for a specific year. 

In order to crystallise a customer must have completed any EOPS relevant for that tax year. If the EOPS has not been finalised with a declaration then a customer will not be able to crystallise. 

When a customer is ready to crystallise they will have to let HMRC know that they intend to crystallise.  This will involve providing any additional information for their entire income, e.g. interest, dividends other SA schedules. If they do not have any additional information to provide they will still need to confirm that they have none.

**Note** - a customer will not be able to crystallise until they have followed the above steps. 

Once the customer has provided their intention to crystallise they will need to review the final calculation. The customer must view the calculation before they declare, to ensure they accept the liability calculation.

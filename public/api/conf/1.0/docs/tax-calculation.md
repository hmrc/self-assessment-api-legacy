This section allows an API developer to trigger a year-to-date tax calculation for a taxpayer. A calculation may only 
be triggered when data about the taxpayers income, expenses etc. has been provided. 

When a tax calculation is triggered, a check will also be performed to see whether or not the taxpayer has 
met their obligations. If you wish to retrieve the status of the taxpayers updated obligations, you can use the 
provided obligation APIs.

Here, the developer can:

* Trigger a tax calculation.
* Retrieve the result of a previously triggered tax calculation.
